        //Pseudo Code
//1. WHat will I need to make this game?
//I will need an alphabet array, variable 
//I will need a 'for'loop??
// I will need if/else/else if statements for right and wrong guesses??
//I will need to use document.getElementById().innerHTML

//2. How is this game played?
//  Player loses a guess each time the wrong letter is pressed.
//  Player wins when the correct letter is pressed
//  The game resets after player makes the correct guess

//3. What will the computer do when player presses the correct letter?
//  When the wrong letter is guessed the remaining Guesses decrease by 1 from 9 until 0 guesses remain, game over.
//If the right letter is pressed the Wins increase by one
//If all 9 guesses are used, the Loss increases by 1.
